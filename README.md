## HOW TO ACCESS MRI
The images from the MRI are not in a standard format, they are in the DICOM format which require DICOM viewers to inspect properly.
I am attaching the files and link to one of those viewers that is easy to setup (requires windows device).

  => There are 2 folders on the drive link:
  
	=> "complete" : Standalone folder that doesn't require any additional setup or for you to download the DICOM viewer but may be slower
 
	=> "imgs only": only the DICOM files (smaller in size) which can be used with the DICOM viewer that you download.
